# CrowdProcess Presentation

I don't have much time for this, and it could be largely improved. And it will...

## Instructions

Exactly what you would expect:

1. Install [Node](http://nodejs.org) and NPM (comes with Node);
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) globally with `npm install grunt -g` (you might need to use sudo);
2. `git clone git@github.com:joaojeronimo/CrowdProcessPresentation.git`;
3. `cd CrowdProcessPresentation`;
4. `grunt`
5. `node server.js`
6. Launch your browser and point it to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

## TODO

* Have better content and structure for the presentation;
* Editable examples;
* Showcase the API Keys (no need for username and password);
* Visualization of the results in the examples;
